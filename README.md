### Goal

Create a project where I can improve my knowledge of performing API requests in Swift.
Also practice a little bit more about Structs, Protocols, the Delegate and MVC patterns.

### Project

The app gives you the latest Bitcoin prices in all popular, traded currencies.

### Some of the things I've used

- UIPickerView from UIKit to show all the available currencies
- URLSession to make HTTP requests to the CoinAPI
- JSONDecoder for JSON parsing
- Delegate pattern to update the UI
- MVC design pattern
